It is calculated by taking the average of the accuracy scores for each class, weighted by the number of samples in each class.\n>\n>MAA is a useful metric because it provides a single value that summarizes the overall accuracy of a model across all classes. This makes it easy to compare the performance of different models on the same dataset.\n>\n>To calculate MAA, the following steps are taken:\n>\n>1. For each class, calculate the accuracy score as follows:\n>\n>```\n>Accuracy = (Number of correctly classified samples in class) / (Total number of samples in class)\n>```\n>\n>2. Multiply each accuracy score by the number of samples in the corresponding class.\n>\n>3. Sum the values obtained in step 2.\n>\n>4. Divide the sum by the total number of samples in the dataset.\n>\n>The resulting value is the MAA score.\n>\n>MAA can be expressed as a percentage or as a decimal value between 0 and 1. A higher MAA score indicates better overall accuracy.\n>\n>Here are some advantages of using MAA:\n>\n>* It is a simple and intuitive metric that is easy to understand.\n>* It provides a single value that summarizes the overall accuracy of a model across all classes.\n>* It is a relatively robust metric that is not as sensitive to outliers as some other metrics, such as accuracy.\n>\n>Here are some disadvantages of using MAA:\n>\n>* It can be misleading if the dataset is imbalanced, i.e., if there are significantly more samples in some classes than in others.\n>* It does not take into account the severity of misclassifications. For example, misclassifying a sample from one class as another class may be more severe than misclassifying a sample from one class as a third class.\n>\n>Overall, MAA is a useful metric for evaluating the performance of multi-class classification models. However, it is important to be aware of its limitations and to use it in conjunction with other metrics to get a complete picture of a model's performance."
